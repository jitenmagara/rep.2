    <p>Trinity was the code name given to the nuclear test that saw the first detonation of a nuclear weapon. The code name was
    assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, after a poem by John Donne. It was
    conducted on July 16, 1945, as part of the Manhattan Project on the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range in the Jornada
    del Muerto desert.</p>

    <p>The test was the first of its kind, and it marked the beginning of the nuclear age. It was a key moment in the history
    of the Manhattan Project, which was a secret research and development project that aimed to develop the first
    nuclear weapons. The test was conducted as part of the Manhattan Project, which was a secret research and development project
    that aimed to develop the first nuclear weapons. The test was conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the
    Los Alamos Laboratory, which was responsible for the design and construction of the bomb.</p>

    <br><p>The test used a Fat Man bomb of the same design as that detonated over Nagasaki. The complex design of the
    implosion-type nuclear weapon required a major effort from the Los Alamos Laboratory, and testing was required to allay
    fears that it would not work. Its detonation (video featured) produced the explosive power of about 20 kilotons of TNT
    (84 terajoules).</p>

    <p>The test was conducted at 05:29:45 (Mountain War Time) on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity site in the New Mexico desert,
    about 35 km (22 mi) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico. The site was chosen because it was remote, sparsely populated, and
    had a flat, dry lake bed that would allow for the construction of a large tower to hold the bomb. The site was
    previously used for military exercises and was part of the White Sands Proving Ground, which was        established in 1945
    to test the effects of nuclear weapons.</p>
    <p>The test site is now part of the White Sands Missile Range. It was declared a National Historic
    Landmark District in 1965, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year. (This article is
